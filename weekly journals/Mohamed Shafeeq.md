# Week 1
Tasks worked on: Deciding a design pattern for implementing bullet collison with tank. Came up with the Strategy design pattern to implement bullet collision feature. Set up the interface for the strategies.

Blockers: None

Feedback: Gathered feedback to keep the initial phase of the project to be simple and understandable. And suggested to keep the important tasks at priority first and to finish the remaining towards the end. Gave feedback for using Observer pattern for Tank Life detection. And gathered feedback on having level2 in the game. 

# Week 2
Tasks worked on: Deciding how many strategies to set for bullet collision. Finalised on two strategies, "Health1Strategy" (after taking damages from the bullet), "Health0Strategy" (after health becomes zero). Created a skeleton for both the strategy classes. 

Blockers: None

Feedback: Gave feedback on conducting meetings twice a week for efficient communication and flow of project. Gathered feedback on having AI tanks as enemies. 

# Week 3
Tasks worked on: Implemented the code for displaying strategies. Added functionality for detecting bullet intersection with any Tank (P1, P2 and NPC) in "Bullet" class. 

Blockers: P2 tank not being displayed in the world, therefore the bullet collision was not being displayed for the respective tank. 

Feedback: Gathered feedback on having friendly fires in the game. 

# Week 4
Tasks worked on: Added final images for the respective strategies and changed imaging scaling a bit. Setting initial health as 3 for P1 and p2 tanks (they can take only 3 bullets per life). Testing the code. Refactoring and internal documentation of the code. 

Blockers: None

Feedback: Gathered feedback on having a button for tutorials in the Menu Screen.
