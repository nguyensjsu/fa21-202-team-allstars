## Week 1
Tasks worked on: Come up with the design pattern that I’ll be using in my code. Create tank objects and give them an appearance.

Tasks planned for the upcoming week: Design and implement the code for tank movement controls and shoot using the decided pattern.

Blockers: None

Courage demonstrated: In the first week, the team demonstrated courage in exploring a domain which was quite new to all members which is the game development. The team had to explore and get hands-on new tools like Greenfoot for the same. Also, the team members showed courage in coming with a project from scratch rather than using an existing one and enhancing it.

## Week 2
Tasks worked on: Designed and implemented tank movement controls and shoot functionality using Command pattern.

Tasks planned for upcoming week: Implement obstacle detection-based movement for tank, get health and reduce health functionality. 

Blocker: None

Courage demonstrated: Team members showed courage in picking up individual features for each one of them although there wasn’t complete clarity on how these features would be implemented. The team explored Greenfoot and picked up design patterns for implementation of their respective feature. This is where the members showed courage even though there was certain confusion in which pattern to implement for the chosen feature.

## Week 3
Tasks worked on: Implemented obstacle detection for smoother movement of tanks in all directions and provided functionality to fetch the tank’s health and reduce tank’s health upon bullet collision.

Tasks planned for upcoming week: Change tank and bullet appearance and remove redundant code.

Blocker: None

Courage: The team decided to involve bot tanks in the game and add an additional difficulty level to the game. This decision was courageous since implementing the bots are tricky and addition of another level to the game required more designs and tricky logics to be implemented. The team members were courageous to contribute on their part required for these additional features. The members were also was courageous enough to point out the blockers that any of them might be facing because of pending implementation from their peers.

## Week 4
Tasks worked on: Changed tank and bullet appearances. Refactored the code. Eliminated bugs in code.

Blocker: None

Courage: Having integrated all the team members’ code, it was now time to test and fix issues that might arise during integration. All team members showed courage in accepting issues with their code if any that affected the integration and fix it accordingly. Week 4 being the final week of project did incur the pressure to implement the remaining feature, thorough testing, fixing bugs and cosmetic upgradations to the project which the team handled seamlessly by each member taking up topics and ensuring the project is completed as expected.
